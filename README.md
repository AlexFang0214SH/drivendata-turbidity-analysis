datascience-turbidity
==============================

In this project, we analyze data from [Driven Data's](https://www.drivendata.org/) 
[Sustainable Industry: Rinse Over Run](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/56/predict-cleaning-time-series/) competition,
in which we attempt to predict the cleanliness of food/beverage-producing machinery,
given high-frequency time series data coming from various sensors across the machinery,
with the end-goal of preserving resources by optimizing cleaning time.

## A few things to know
* For more details on the context of the data, I'd encourage you to visit the [competition homepage](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/56/predict-cleaning-time-series/).
* For a tangible look at my data processesing, analysis, and model, I'd encourage to you view [this notebook](https://github.com/spindance/datascience-turbidity/blob/master/1.2-cjp-ABR-model.ipynb).
* The data for this project can be found at `s3://datascience-turbidity/data/raw/`, or can be downloaded directly at [this site](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/56/predict-cleaning-time-series/page/139/).
